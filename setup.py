SUMMARY = 'Dejavu: Audio Fingerprinting in Python'
DESCRIPTION = """
Audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in Python

See the explanation here: 

`http://willdrevo.com/fingerprinting-and-audio-recognition-with-python/`__

Dejavu can memorize recorded audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting 
it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input or on disk file, 
Dejavu attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the 
database, returning the song or recording being played.
